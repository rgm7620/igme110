                Epic games created a scandal around the release of the game Borderlands 3, 
                which released in September. Much of this scandal is sourced from Epic's 
                exclusivity deal with the developers of Borderlands 3, which upset many 
                fans who were excited to see the game on Steam, and didn't trust Epic's 
                launcher due to information regarding a lack of security and/or spyware.

                Another scandal Epic conjured regarded Borderlands content creator Supmatto. 
                After Supmatto reported on potential leaked content for Borderlands 3 on his 
                YouTube channel, he was approached by private investigators hired by Epic Games' 
                parent company Take-Two, and asked about the leaks. After talking to the investigators, 
                many of Supmatto's social media accounts and other content outlets were deactivated 
                or banned. This sets a dangerous precedent towards companies being able to threaten 
                and destroy the livelihoods of common people. As such, many outraged gamers are 
                boycotting Borderlands 3 over Supmatto's situation.

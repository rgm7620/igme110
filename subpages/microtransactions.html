                    EA has been under a lot of scrutiny due to a problem with the microtransactions 
                    in their recent games. In particular, Star Wars Battlefront 2 has been a target 
                    of a lot of criticism due to their system on microtransactions vs gaining 
                    the content for free. "Pay to win" is a phrase that often used in this 
                    situation, where players can pay additional money to gain fast amounts 
                    of progress or power in the game.

                    While microtransactions like this are necessary in games that are free 
                    in order to make some sort of revenue, Battlefront 2 is a full priced game at $60. 
                    This brings a huge issue where players are already paying a lot for the game itself, 
                    and content that should be easily available without paying isnt. During the early stages 
                    of the games existence, a reddit user calculated that it would take 80 hours of gameplay 
                    to earn a single character. Microtransactions continue to be an issue in gaming as corporations 
                    try to squeeze some extra cash out of their game.
